 * reads any rejected pass as an outage and doubles its interval, up to a 15
 * minute ceiling that then holds every healthy repository with it.
 *
 * One defect escaped `stageReviewGateStatus` on every pass for a day. The
 * configured 60 second observation loop ran every 18 minutes for as long as it
 * lasted, and nothing in the log said why.
 *
 * A step that throws answers with `fallback`, so the pass reads it as an empty
 * result and carries on to the steps behind it.
