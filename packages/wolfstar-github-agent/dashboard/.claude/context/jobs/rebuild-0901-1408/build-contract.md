# Build contract: dashboard rebuild (rebuild-0901-1408)

Spec: `DESIGN.md`. Vocabulary: `../GLOSSARY.md`. Data: `src/types.ts` (`DashboardSnapshot`), state and writes in `app/composables/useDashboard.ts`, pure presentation in `app/utils/dashboard.ts`.

Every page is rebuilt from scratch on the new foundation (Phase 1). Keep the composable contract and pure utils; add to them, remove dead branches, keep tests green in `test/dashboard-view.test.ts`, `test/stats-view.test.ts`, `test/hogwild-status.test.ts`, `test/eject-recovery.test.ts`. A behaviour changed on purpose deletes its old test and writes the new one.

## What will be built

### Shell (`app/layouts/default.vue`, `app/app.vue`, `app/components/`)

- 48px header: wordmark; tabs Board, History, Watching, Stats (below `md` the tabs move into the overflow menu).
- `SystemChip.vue`: `n/3` agents, state dot (grey normal, amber cannot start with reason, red Incident count). Opens `SystemSlideover.vue`.
- `SystemSlideover.vue`: Capacity, Incidents, Routines (only when present), Host (only on the Tailscale host). Disclosures for Routine candidates and terminal.
- `AgentSelectionMenu.vue`: button shows current provider; menu shows models, Reasoning effort, `Follow configuration`, `Automatic`, and a read only per-role model list.
- Pause / Resume button.
- `OverflowMenu.vue`: Selection mode (Auto / Manual), Restart after current work, Notifications (opt in toggle), Theme, Keyboard, How it works (`/flow`).
- Banners kept: stale snapshot (after 90s, content gets `.stale`), eject notice with copyable command, restart request state.
- Tab title carries the Needs you count; favicon carries its colour. Skip link kept.
- No status bar, no footer.

### Board (`app/pages/index.vue` + `_Board*.vue` locals)

- `IncidentRow` above columns when any unresolved Incident exists: kind, scope link, message, Recovery, occurrences, age. Links to the System slideover.
- Work kind filter, hidden until two kinds are present.
- Four columns on `bg-muted` surfaces: Needs you, Up next (Queued with position; Waiting group below for Pending, dashed cards), Running (agents plus Active entries with no session), Done (eight, then a link to History).
- `BoardCard.vue`: face per DESIGN.md "Cards". Primary action inline for Needs you (`Review and repair` / `Approve`). `Eject` inline on Running (arm then confirm). Overflow menu: Open on GitHub, Rerun review (only when `canRunReview`), Cancel, Dismiss. Cancel and Dismiss open `ConfirmModal.vue`.
- `CardSlideover.vue`: full reason, `DetailList` (session, commit, agent, revision as links), terminal (`.terminal`), actions.
- Empty column copy from one pure function (`columnEmptyReason`) replacing the duplicated `nothingQueuedReason` / `queueDetail` mapping. Resume control inline when Paused.
- Keyboard: `j` `k` through Needs you, `a` presses its primary action, `?` opens the keyboard list.

### History (`app/pages/history.vue`)

- Outcome filter pills, Stats range strip with Clear when arriving from Stats.
- Divided list rows: outcome badge, work chip, identity, relative time, duration. Row click opens `EvidenceSlideover.vue`: gates, findings, agent (provider, model, version), Review usage, session id with copy, commit link, canonical comment link, Agent feedback (`UTextarea` plus Useful / Noisy / Wrong; hidden once recorded, showing the recorded verdict instead).
- `Rerun review` in the row overflow menu only on the current revision.

### Watching (`app/pages/watching.vue`)

- Repository table in its own scroll container: repository link, health badge, open count, ownership, writes, agents, last success. Writes and Pause controls in a row overflow menu; enabling writes confirms in a modal.
- `/` focuses the filter through a template ref.
- Open items list with All / Pull requests / Issues filter.
- Dismissed group with Restore, only when any exist.

### Stats (`app/pages/stats.vue` + `_Stats*.vue`)

- Range form (two date inputs, 7 / 30 / 90 presets, Apply), URL is the source of truth.
- Outcome chart and daily chart with no captions; the chart title carries the meaning. Bars start at zero, direct labels, no legend, no library.
- Work table with Evidence links into History.
- Loading skeleton, range error, load error with Retry, empty state with `Show 90 days`.

### Flow (`app/pages/flow.vue`)

- Same content, rebuilt on tokens with no scoped CSS beyond what Tailwind cannot express. `.field-label` headings only. Reached from the overflow menu.

## Testable behaviours

### Shell

- [S1] GIVEN any route, WHEN the page renders, THEN one header of height 48px exists and no footer or status bar element exists.

- [B5] GIVEN a Queued entry, WHEN the board renders, THEN the card shows its position in mono and sits in Up next.
- [B6] GIVEN a Pending entry, WHEN the board renders, THEN the card sits under Waiting with a dashed border, shows the reason, and shows no position.

- [K2] GIVEN `/kit`, WHEN the build runs, THEN `/kit` is not in `.output/public` prerender output and no page links to it.

## Design expectations

- Tokens only. No hex, no `gray-`/`zinc-`/`slate-`/`stone-`, no shadows outside overlays.
- Type never above 1.125rem. `.field-label` is the only section heading style.
- Semantic colour only on badges, dots, the Needs you hairline, and the Incident row.
- Octicons only, `currentColor`.
- One solid button per card or modal.
- The design principle, "the exception over the inventory", shows as: a board that is mostly paper when nothing needs Wolfstar, and one amber card that is the most saturated thing on screen when something does.

## Out of scope

- Service or API changes. The dashboard consumes the existing `DashboardSnapshot` and endpoints.
- New pages beyond `/kit`.
- Chart libraries.
- Optimistic updates.
