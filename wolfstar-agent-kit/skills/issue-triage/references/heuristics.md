# Triage Heuristics

## Difficulty Scale (1-5)

| Score | Meaning                          | Signals                                                      |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Typo, config, or docs change     | Single line, obvious fix                                     |
| 2     | Single-file logic change         | Clear reproduction, isolated scope                           |
| 3     | Multi-file change, needs testing | Touches multiple modules, needs new tests                    |
| 4     | Architectural or cross-cutting   | Design decisions required, multiple subsystems               |
| 5     | Unknown scope, research needed   | No repro, vague description, set `needsCodebaseReview: true` |

| ----- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Cosmetic, niche use case          | Low comment count, edge-case scenario                |
| 2     | Minor improvement, few users      | Nice-to-have enhancement                             |
| 3     | Moderate user-facing value        | Several users affected, reasonable workaround exists |
| 4     | Significant pain point            | High comment count, common request, poor workaround  |
| 5     | Critical bug, data loss, security | Production breakage, no workaround                   |

## Signal Weighting

- **Comment count** — high count → community interest/severity
- **Assignees** — someone may already be working on it
- **Labels** — "good first issue" suggests low difficulty, "bug" usually higher impact than "enhancement"
- **Age** — old + no assignee → possibly stale or deprioritized
- **Reproduction** — stackblitz/codesandbox links, minimal repos, clear steps → `hasRepro: true`
- **Cross-references** — multiple issues mentioning the same root cause → higher effective impact
