# Nuxt Release Note Format Reference

This is the exact structure Nuxt uses for minor/major releases (e.g., v3.16.0, v3.15.0).

## Structure

````markdown
# vX.Y.Z

## 👀 Highlights

Brief 1-2 sentence intro setting the tone for the release.

### ⚡️ Feature Name

Narrative explanation of the feature: what problem it solves, how it works, what it enables for users. Keep it 2-4 sentences.

```ts
// Minimal code example showing the new API
const example = useNewFeature()
```
````

### 🚀 Another Feature

Same narrative pattern. Each highlight gets its own H3 with a relevant emoji.

> [!TIP]
> Optional callout boxes for important notes, tips, or warnings.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

Only present if there are breaking changes. Each breaking change gets:

### Changed: `oldApi` → `newApi`

Explanation of what changed and why. Include before/after:

**Before:**

```ts
oldWay()
```

**After:**

```ts
newWay()
```

## ✅ Upgrading

Run the following command to upgrade:

```bash
npx nuxi upgrade
```

Or update manually:

```bash
pnpm add -D nuxt@latest
```

## Tone & Style

- Enthusiastic but professional; never breathless or salesy
- Highlights explain "why it matters" not just "what changed"
- Code examples are minimal, just enough to show the new pattern
- No em dashes; use commas, semicolons, or separate sentences
- Bold for emphasis sparingly
- Links to PRs use shorthand: `([#123](url))`
- Skip empty changelog categories entirely
```
