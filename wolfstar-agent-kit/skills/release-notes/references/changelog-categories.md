## Breaking Change Detection

A commit is breaking if ANY of these are true:

1. Type has `!` suffix: `feat!:`, `fix!:`, `refactor!:`
2. Commit body contains `BREAKING CHANGE:` (case-sensitive per spec)
3. PR has a `breaking` or `breaking-change` label

## Scope Extraction

Scopes in parentheses map to subsections or tags:

- `feat(router):` → listed under Enhancements, tagged with `router`
- `fix(ssr):` → listed under Fixes, tagged with `ssr`

Use scopes to group related changes when a single scope has 3+ entries.

## Filtering Rules

- Merge commits (`Merge branch`, `Merge pull request`) → exclude
- Revert commits → include with note about what was reverted
- Release commits (`chore: release`, `chore: bump`) → exclude
- Dependency bumps (`chore(deps):`) → collapse into single line unless security-related
