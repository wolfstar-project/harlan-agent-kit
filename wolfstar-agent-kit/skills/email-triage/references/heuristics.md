# Email Triage Heuristics

## Urgency Scale (1-5)

| Score | Meaning                            | Signals                                                                               |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Noise, safe to delete              | Newsletters, expired promos, automated notifications with no action needed            |
| 2     | Low priority, route and forget     | Receipts, subscription confirmations, resolved notifications                          |
| 3     | Moderate, action within a few days | Non-urgent client emails, project updates, billing notices                            |
| 4     | Important, action today            | Direct client requests, time-sensitive finance, support tickets awaiting response     |
| 5     | Critical, action now               | Urgent client escalation, security alerts, payment failures, deadline-driven requests |

## Category Routing

| Category     | Typical Senders                           | Default Action       | Target Folder            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| client       | Client domains, known contacts            | reply or move        | Clients/<name>           |
| finance      | Stripe, PayPal, Mercury, Airwallex, banks | move                 | Finance/<provider>       |
| notification | GitHub, NPM, Slack                        | move or delete       | Notifications/<service>  |
| newsletter   | Mailing lists, marketing                  | delete               | Trash or Auto Purge      |
| spam         | Unknown senders, suspicious patterns      | delete               | Trash                    |
| personal     | Known personal contacts                   | skip (keep in inbox) | INBOX                    |
| project      | Nuxt SEO, Request Indexing related        | move                 | Projects/<name>          |
| automated    | CI/CD, monitoring, system alerts          | move or delete       | ZMNotification or delete |

## Signal Weighting

- **Sender recognition** -- known client/contact → higher urgency. Unknown sender + marketing language → lower.
- **Subject keywords** -- "urgent", "action required", "payment failed", "overdue" → boost urgency. "Newsletter", "digest", "weekly" → lower.
- **Age** -- unread email older than 7 days with no follow-up is likely low urgency or already handled elsewhere.
- **Reply expectation** -- direct questions, "can you", "please confirm", "when can" → suggestedAction: reply.
- **Thread depth** -- if reading full body reveals an ongoing conversation awaiting response → boost urgency.
- **Attachment presence** -- `has_attachment: true` on client/finance emails → slightly higher urgency (may contain invoices, contracts).
- **Flags** -- already `Seen` → user has glanced at it, may have mentally deprioritized. Still triage normally but note it.

## Folder Matching Heuristics

When suggesting a destination folder, match by:

1. **Sender domain** → client folder (e.g., `@odysseytraveller.com` → `Clients/odysseytraveller.com`)
2. **Sender service** → notification/finance folder (e.g., `@github.com` → `Notifications/GitHub`, `@stripe.com` → `Finance/Stripe`)
3. **Subject keywords** → project folder (e.g., "Nuxt SEO" → `Projects/Nuxt SEO Pro`)
4. **Fallback** → if no clear match, suggest `move` to most relevant parent category or `skip`
